# Skypay Banking App - Technical Test

This small project implements a simple `Account` with deposit, withdraw, and printStatement methods.

How to run tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Notes:
- Dates are injected via `DateProvider` to make testing deterministic.
- `Account` uses an in-memory `ArrayList<Transaction>` as requested.
